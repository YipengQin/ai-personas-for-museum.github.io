            <h3> Can AI Personas Bring Historic Figures to 'Life'?</h3>
            <p>
                What if you could have a real conversation with Florence Nightingale about her trailblazing work in nursing or ask Queen Elizabeth I for her personal take on leading in a male-dominated world? New AI research is turning this into reality by developing remarkably realistic digital personas of iconic figures

                Join us as we explore this fascinating field enabling museums and archives to simulate historical legends across all eras and domains. In our upcoming event “Past Meets Future: Can AI Personas Bring Historic Figures to 'Life'?”, experts from various academic disciplines and industries will demonstrate this pioneering technology’s enormous potential while tackling its complex issues and future possibilities from a wide lens encompassing technology, ethics, social impacts, visitor experience and beyond. Our vision is to enable the public to meet AI personas from pioneers like Charles Darwin to heroes like Emmeline Pankhurst—and engage them in natural conversation to uncover new dimensions of their lives and work. As this technology emerges, we'll dive into key opportunities and challenges it presents for revolutionizing how societies teach history, promote cross-cultural dialogue and inspire new breakthroughs informed by our shared past.
            </p>
            <p>We hope this event will be the first step in building a vibrant community for this exciting interdisciplinary field and spark innovative collaborations among stakeholders across various fields.
